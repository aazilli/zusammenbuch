Welcome to Das Zusammenbuch, a dashboard created for the German-English
translator so that they might be spared some fraction of
the agony involved in opening endless browser tabs for each of their
many dictionary needs. Enlist or cull dictionaries on a whim
via the settings page and display them in your preferred order.
</p>

<p>
As of now there are no immediate plans to expand this tool to other languages,
but there will be additional English and German-language dictionaries coming
soon. Candidates include DWDS, Thesaurus.com, TheFreeDictionary.com,
Wiktionary (.en and .de), the Grimm WÃ¶rterbuch, and perhaps even the OED.
</p>

<p>
Feel free to use the form below to share your thoughts, suggestions, bugs
(with a screenshot, if possible), or to recommend a dictionary you might like added.
Das Zusammenbuch was conceived based on my own workflow as a translator, so
tips from other translators will be helpful to me in expanding its functionality.
